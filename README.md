# Oculus WebView Example

This Unity project demonstrates how to use the [Vuplex 3D WebView plugin](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) with Oculus Go and Gear VR. It includes the [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package, so the only thing you must import is the [3D WebView for Android plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-android-137030).
